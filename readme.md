# twitter-userscripts
These are all of the user-scripts I use to customize Twitter (formerly X) to my liking. You may use these as well if you want!

## List of userscripts
You can click any of the links to install the user-script (if you have a user-script extension, like Tampermonkey)!
- [`x-to-twitter`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ascpixi/twitter-userscripts/main/x-to-twitter.user.js) - reverts all "X" branding to "Twitter" (also affects icons).
